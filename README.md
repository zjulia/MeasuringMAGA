# MeasuringMAGA
Albert Qian's brain child, to keep the government accountable for Making America Great Again.

For a couple of interesting key indicators that he brought up during the Republican national convention
I want to compile all of these things into a website and see at the end of his four years how well everything has been executed and whether America is made 'great' again

So we would measure:

One, economic growth with respect to unemployment rate, GDP, and stock market.

Two we would look at the growth or fall of crime overall and within the top three metropolitan areas including Chicago with respect to gun deaths.

Three, we would measure the amount of domestic and international terrorist attacks on American soil. We would see whether most of these attacks occur because of Isis or domestic terrorism.

And I am wondering how we can integrate artificial intelligence and NLP into this
I also want to see how Muslim rights, LGBT rights, and black lives factor into this time as well
I would also love to link this up to some RSS feed from reputable websites on both the conservative and liberal side that feed into how we measure how America is being made great

How much of it can we automate?
Like, when there are new unemployment numbers, stock market numbers, that numbers, and the GDP numbers, we should not have to pull these manually
And I am wondering if we can use this RSS feed to also calculate how many crimes against a particular group of people happen on a day-to-day basis using artificial intelligence

I think if we were able to measure every single politicians impact using something like this, we would be able to hold our government more accountable
